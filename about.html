             My journey into tech has been anything but linear. With a degree in Information Systems and Sociology from Singapore Management University, I built a career in tech sales, working with global companies like HubSpot, Microsoft, and Sony. For a long time, I thought programming wasn‚Äôt for me, but my inner creative urge to design and code never left. This year, I made the bold decision to pivot, dedicating myself to front-end development.
              </p>
             <p>
            Reconnecting with this long-held passion has been transformative. I‚Äôve poured countless hours every day into self-learning, constantly pushing myself to improve. The challenge‚Äîand occasional frustrations‚Äîof learning something new excites me, and it‚Äôs what helped me complete the SheCodes Front-End Certification in three months instead of the typical eight. Since then, I‚Äôve continued honing my skills in JavaScript and React, with projects shared on my GitHub.
              <p>
            My diverse background gives me a unique edge as a developer. Coming from a sales career, I‚Äôve learned the importance of clarity in communication and decision-making‚Äîskills that directly translate into my work as a front-end developer. Whether in sales or web design, clear thinking leads to better user experiences. I approach design with a focus on delivering both aesthetic appeal and clarity of function, ensuring that every decision serves a purpose. I believe good design is not just about looks; it‚Äôs about creating an intuitive, seamless experience that solves real problems. I strive to blend form, function, and clarity in every project, making sure that what I build is not only visually engaging but also easy to use and navigate.
             </p>
              <p>
              Outside of coding, I‚Äôm a community builder at heart. I‚Äôve been organizing queer nightlife events across Southeast Asia, curating spaces where people can connect, express themselves, and thrive. In many ways, I see coding as a similar form of creation‚Äîit‚Äôs about crafting experiences that connect with people, whether through a digital interface or a physical space.
I‚Äôm a lifelong learner, always exploring new ideas, from spirituality and science to productivity and personal growth. I believe that growth happens both inside and outside of work, and I‚Äôm constantly seeking ways to evolve‚Äîwhether by refining my coding skills or gaining a deeper understanding of the world around me.
            </p>
              <p>
           Moving forward, I‚Äôm excited to continue this journey of discovery and creation, building meaningful, user-centered web experiences that leave a lasting impact.
